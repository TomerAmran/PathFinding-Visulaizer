# PathFinding-Visulaizer
This is a simple Dijkstra algorithem visualizer.
The grid represent *directed* graph.
A number inside a cell represent the "cost of entering the cell.
The yello path represent the shortest path from strat point to target.

# What I've Learned
Actually, implementing the Dijkstra algorithm was the lease challenging task. 
Most of the work was setting-up the user interface. 
I'v learned allot about JS DOM event listeners.
